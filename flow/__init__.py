"""Integration of learnable vector fields as ODEs (flows) and SDEs (processes).

``Flow`` integrates a deterministic velocity field and supports forward/backward
sampling as well as exact density evaluation via ``push_forward`` /
``push_backward``. ``Process`` integrates the corresponding SDE (diffusion).
See ``flow/README.md`` for the mathematical conventions.
