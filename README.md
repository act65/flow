The repository provided utilities for working with neural flows such as those defined in;

- [Flow Matching for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747)
- [Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03003)
- [Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797)

# TODO

- support variable step size integration
- support stochastic differential equations
- move to Diffrax / similar to integrate the dynamical systems
<!-- - support entropy calculation -->
